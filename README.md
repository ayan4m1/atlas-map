# ATLAS Map

## Usage

First, you need to open a project in the [Server Grid Editor](https://github.com/GrapeshotGames/ServerGridEditor). Then, click on `Generate Slippy Map (Optional Tools)` under the `Export` menu bar entry. Create a new output directory and select it. The export process will take anywhere from one to _many_ minutes depending mainly on the size and scale of the grid.
