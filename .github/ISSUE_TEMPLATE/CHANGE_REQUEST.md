**Describe the change**

Describe the change you'd like to see. It might be helpful to tell a story that starts with a _problem_ with the way things are, has a middle where something _changes_, and an ending where things are _better_. For example:

> As a server operator, I don't see a nav bar or header above the map. This means that users cannot see the name of my server at the same time as the map.

> I would like to add a nav bar at the top of the screen that contains configurable text.

> This change would allow me to put the name of my server front and center. It adds useful information to the screen with little cost in terms of complexity or screen space.
